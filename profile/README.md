## 🕹️ What is GameBuild?

GameBuild is a no-code Web3 game creation platform where users can build 3D worlds, design interactive gameplay, and publish decentralized games using NFT assets. Creators can monetize their games with token mechanics, rent or sell NFT content, and deploy their experiences inside open metaverse ecosystems.

No coding knowledge is required — just creativity and vision.
